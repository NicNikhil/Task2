            According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), as of 2020, a staggering 763 million young individuals and adults still lacked essential literacy skills. Recent crises – the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change impacts, and conflicts – have only worsened the existing challenges.

            In India, in terms of education level, 9,30,531 children were identified as out of school at the elementary level and 3,22,488 at the secondary level. (National Education Ministry, 2022-23)
            <br><br>
            The literacy rate in rural India is 67.77 per cent, while in urban India, it is 84.11 per cent. Although the literacy rate gap in urban and rural areas is steadily declining, the divide still exists.
